<!-- * What is TypeScript? -->
# TypeScript is an open-source pure object-oriented programming language. It is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript which compiles to plain JavaScript. It contains all elements of JavaScript. It is a language designed for large-scale JavaScript application development, which can be executed on any browser, any Host, and any Operating System. TypeScript is a language as well as a set of tools.
# -> TypeScript is the ES6 version of JavaScript with some additional features.TypeScript files use the .ts extension rather than the .js extension of JavaScript files

<!-- * Why use TypeScript? -->
# -> We use TypeScript because of the following benefits.TypeScript supports Static typing, Strong typing, Modules, Optional Parameters, etc.
# -> TypeScript supports object-oriented programming features such as classes, interfaces, inheritance, generics, etc.TypeScript is fast, simple, and most importantly, easy to learn.
# -> TypeScript provides the error-checking feature at compilation time. It will compile the code, and if any error is found, then it highlights the mistakes before the script is run.
# -> TypeScript supports all JavaScript libraries because it is the superset of JavaScript.TypeScript supports reusability because of the inheritance.
# -> TypeScript makes app development as quick and easy as possible, and the tooling support of TypeScript gives us autocompletion, type checking, and source documentation.
# -> TypeScript has a definition file with .d.ts extension to define external JavaScript libraries.
# -> TypeScript supports the latest JavaScript features, including ECMAScript 2015.
# -> TypeScript gives all the benefits of ES6 plus more productivity.
# -> Developers can save a lot of time with TypeScript

<!-- * Advantage of TypeScript over JavaScript -->
# -> TypeScript always highlights errors at compilation time during development, whereas JavaScript points out errors at runtime.
# -> TypeScript supports strongly typed or static typing, whereas this is not in JavaScript.TypeScript runs on any browser or JavaScript engine.
# -> Great tooling supports with IntelliSense which provides active hints as the code is added.
# -> It has a namespace concept by defining a module

<!-- * Disadvantage of TypeScript over JavaScript -->
# -> TypeScript takes a long time to compile the code.
# -> TypeScript does not support abstract classes.
# -> If we run the TypeScript application in the browser, a compilation step is required to transform TypeScript into JavaScript.
